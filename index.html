  <p>My name is Diego Alonso Vargas Duharte - thanks Mr. Obvious. I have experience in <em>research, development and implementation of new technologies</em> for high-end vehicles, and process development and improvement. High communication,
    leadership and teamwork skills. I'm also productive, proactive and constantly developing a multidisciplinary mindset. I have a great ability to adapt quickly and effectively to different contexts. I'm ambitious and looking forward to using
    technology and creativity to solve challenging problems.

    <li>
      <p><strong>Andean Experience S.A.C.</strong><br>
        <em>Commercial Executive</em><br>
        Lima, Peru - Feb 2019 to May 2020 <br>
        Responsible for selling luxury services to several client accounts from around the world. Increased average annual sales by 15% over the course of one year and actively contributed to the improvement of: 1) the sales process, 2) the user
        experience (physical and digital), 3) the customer journey, and 4) benchmarking.

      <p><strong>AGP Group</strong> <br>
        <em>Research and Development Engineer</em> <br>
        Lima, Peru - Mar 2017 to Feb 2018 <br>
        Responsible for the research, development and implementation of new technologies to improve the efficiency of embedded heating systems for smart windshields. Improved heating systems and reduced the traditional technology’s deicing time from
        20 to 5 minutes. Proposed, planned, managed and led the development of a new process in the production line that modified the tools of an existing CNC (computer numerically controlled) machine in order to enable its wire embedding potential,
        which allowed the embedding of ultra-thin tungsten wire into PVB (polyvinyl butyral). This new process – previously performed by a third-party in the US – reduced production time by more than 80% (mainly because AGP Group had been flying the
        PVB from Peru to the US and back for several years, and we eliminated the need to do that) and reduced costs by more than 50%. Prepared several windshield and glass roof prototypes, some of which were tested in the US on electric vehicles,
        including a fully working prototype of the Tesla Model X windshield that achieved a full-windshield deicing time of 4 minutes. Trained plant personnel (engineers and technicians) in the use of the new machinery and methods used to design the
        embedded circuits that were produced using the new embedding process. Created and patented a <a href="https://bit.ly/3mYckjq" target="_blank">technique to embed LEDs into glass laminates</a>.

      <p><strong>AGP Group</strong> <br>
        <em>Research and Development Trainee</em> <br>
        Lima, Peru - Mar 2016 to Feb 2017<br>
        Assigned as the lead of two different projects for automotive smart glass: Invisible Heating and Acoustics. Researched the science behind the technologies, searched for related patents, created prototypes (glass laminates), performed
        validation testing, and implemented a new testing method that suited the company’s needs (low budget, high efficiency). Trained more than 50 co-workers on the basics of both projects and gave presentations to the managers, the board of
        directors, and the CEO of the company.
